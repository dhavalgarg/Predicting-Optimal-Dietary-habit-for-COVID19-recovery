# Research-Paper-Project
This project predicts the optimal dietary habits for Fast Recovery from COVID19 using Machine Learning Techniques.
## Methods used:-
1. Random Forest Classification
2. Boruta Algorithm
***
###Explaination
The project classifies the recovery rate of different countries depending on their diet into categories.
A second python script runs the Boruta Algorithm to find which nutrients from different food items play the most important role in recovery of a person.
***
###Result
It was found that Percentage of protein from Vegetable Oils, Percentage of Fat from Cereals except Beer and Percentage of carbohydrates from Cereals, Milk and Meat were the most important features for Recovery from COVID19.
